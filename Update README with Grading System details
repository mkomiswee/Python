# 📝 Grading System v1

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **menu-driven Python program** that allows users to input student scores and perform operations such as:
- Converting numeric scores into **letter grades (A–F)**
- Calculating the **class average**
- Finding the **highest and lowest scores**
- Filtering **passing vs. failing grades**

It’s designed to practice **functions, loops, conditionals, and list operations** while building a portfolio-ready project.

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive menu for user-friendly navigation  
- Grade conversion logic (90+ = A, 80+ = B, etc.)  
- Class statistics: average, min, max  
- Filter function: separates failing grades from passing ones  
- Dynamic input: refresh scores anytime  

---

## 🧩 How It Works
1. Run the program in your terminal.  
2. Enter student scores separated by spaces.  
3. Use the menu to:
   - Show grades
   - View highest/lowest score
   - Calculate class average
   - Filter passing vs. failing
   - Enter new scores
   - Quit

## 🎯 Learning Goals
This project helps practice:
- Building **modular functions**  
- Designing **menu-driven programs**  
- Applying the **filter pattern** (empty list → loop → condition → append → return)  
- Strengthening GitHub documentation skills  

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add student names alongside scores  
- Save results to a file (CSV or JSON)  
- Expand grading logic to include GPA calculation  
- Build a GUI version with Tkinter or PyQt

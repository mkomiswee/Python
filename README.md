# 🐍 Python Projects Repository

## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to my **Python Projects Repository**!  
This space is dedicated to all the projects I’m building to strengthen my skills in Python programming. Each project is designed to practice core concepts like **functions, loops, conditionals, data structures, and modular design**, while also exploring creative applications.

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here
- **Beginner-friendly programs**: calculators, grading systems, and menu-driven tools  
- **Intermediate projects**: filters, data processing, and interactive logic  
- **Portfolio-ready builds**: documented, organized, and version-controlled for visibility  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a portfolio of practical Python projects  
- Apply coding patterns like filtering and modular functions  
- Share my learning journey with recruiters and peers  
- Demonstrate problem-solving and creativity

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a **Software Engineer** focused on Python development and portfolio building. My approach is hands-on: I dissect, experiment, and refine code to master patterns. This repository is both a **learning dojo** and a **portfolio showcase**.
